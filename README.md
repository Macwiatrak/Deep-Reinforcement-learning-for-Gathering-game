# Deep Reinforcement learning for Gathering & Wolfpack game 

### Introduction

This project is my MSc dissertation at the University of Edinburgh. I extend the [Repeated Update Q-Learning](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/14-037/14-037.pdf) heuristics proposed by Dr. Sherief to the [Nature DQN](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html) framework. 

The two games of Gathering and Wolfpack is orgionally proposed by Dr. Joel and Dr. Vinicius in the paper of  [Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Sequential Social Dilemmas](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/papers/multi-agent-rl-in-ssd.pdf)
